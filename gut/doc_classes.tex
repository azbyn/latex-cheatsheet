\subsection*{Differences with regard to available commands and environments}
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item \book and \report feature the \code{\chapter} sectioning command, while \article doesn't.
\item In \book and \report, \code{\appendix} will cause \code{\chapter}s to be typeset as ``Appendix X'' instead of ``Chapter X''. For article, this isn't applicable.
\item \book and \report will start a new page for \code{\part}s , while \article won't.
\item \book offers the \code{\frontmatter}, \code{\mainmatter}, and \code{\backmatter} commands to control page numbering (Roman for the front matter, arabic elsewhere) and numbering of sectioning titles (no numbering in the front and back matter), while \report and \article don't.
\item \book \textit{doesn't} offer the \code{abstract} environment, while \report and \article \textit{do}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Differences with regard to default settings}
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
  \item The \book class uses the \code{twoside} class option (which means different margins and headers/footers for even and odd pages), while \report and \article use \code{oneside}.
  \item The \book class uses the \code{twoside} class option (which means different margins and headers/footers for even and odd pages), while \report and \article use \code{oneside}.
  \item \book uses \code{openright} (new parts and chapters start on ``right'' pages, adding a blank page before if necessary), while \report uses \code{openany}. (Note that ``right'' means an odd page in twoside mode, but any page in oneside mode.) For \article, the distinction between \code{openright} and \code{openany} isn't applicable.
    
  \item \book uses the \code{headings} pagestyle for non-chapter-starting pages, while \report and \article always use \code{plain}.
    
  \item \book and \report use \code{titlepage} (the title page and -- if applicable -- the \code{abstract} environment will be typeset on pages of their own), while \article uses \code{notitlepage}.
    
  \item For \book and \report, the lowest-level sectioning command which is numbered and incorporated into the table of contents is \code{\subsection}, while for article it is \code{\subsubsection}.
    
  \item \book and \report will use the arguments of \code{\chapter}s and \code{\section}s for running headings (if such headings are present), while \article will use \code{\section}s and \code{\subsection}s.
    
  \item \book and \report will number floats (figures, tables etc.), equations, and footnotes per chapter, while \article will number them continuously. Note that footnotes -- even when numbered per chapter -- do not feature a chapter prefix.

  \item \book and \report will use \code{\bibname} (which defaults to ``Bibliography'') for the heading of bibliographic references, while article will use \code{\refname} (which defaults to ``References'').
\end{itemize}
